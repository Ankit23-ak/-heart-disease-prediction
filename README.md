💓 Heart Disease Prediction (ML)

Predict the likelihood of heart disease from clinical features using classic machine-learning models. This repo includes clean code for data prep, training, evaluation, and deployment via a lightweight API/app.

🚀 Highlights

📊 EDA & preprocessing pipeline (imputation, scaling, encoding)

🤖 Multiple models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN (configurable)

📈 Reproducible evaluation: accuracy, precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix

🧪 Cross-validation & hyperparameter search

🌐 Optional FastAPI endpoint + minimal Streamlit demo

💼 Production-ready structure with requirements.txt and Makefile

🧠 Problem Statement

Given patient attributes (age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal, etc.), predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease (binary classification).

Dataset: common choice is the “Heart Disease” dataset (UCI/Cleveland variant). Place a CSV at data/heart.csv. Ensure your columns match the feature names in src/config.py.💓 Heart Disease Prediction (ML)
